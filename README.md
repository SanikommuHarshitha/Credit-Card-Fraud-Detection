# Credit card fraud detection under extreme Class Imbalance
Project Description: —Credit card based online payments has grown intensely, compelling the financial organizations to implement and continuously improve their fraud detection system. It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. However due to the imbalance data issue, many observations can be predicted as Normal transaction, whereas they are actually Fraud transactions. If we predict that a transaction is fraudulent and turns out not to be, is not a massive problem compared to the opposite situation. Naturally, a credit card owner will not be happy if the credit card is blocked by the bank when no actual fraud had taken place. Machine Learning algorithms are very likely to produce faulty classifiers when they are trained with imbalanced datasets. These algorithms tend to show a bias for the majority class, treating the minority class as a noise in the dataset. With many standard classifier algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Decision Trees, there is a likelihood of the wrong classification of the minority class. This project speaks about the different methods to handle the imbalanced data and the importance.

# Goals and objectives: 
The goal of this project is to detect anonymous credit card transactions and label it as fraudulent or genuine in transactional data. Fraud detection involves monitoring the behavior of users to estimate, detect, or avoid undesirable behavior. The objective is to handle data imbalance problem and create simple and commonly used machine learning models like logistic regression, Random forest and maybe others to compare how they perform regarding the metric chosen (Precision, Recall etc) for the task of predicting fraudulent credit card transactions.
